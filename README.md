# Low Rank Approximation Techniques
This repository contains the implememention side of the leverage score sampling project, carried out in the context of the MATH-403 Low-Rank Approximation Techniques course at EPFL.

## Repository description
- `code` - Implementation of the experiments
  - `utils` - Subfolder with utilities functions
  - `run.m` - Main script to run to reproduce comparison between sampling strategies
  - `lambda_tuning.m` - Secondary script to run to reproduce adaptive regularization parameter experiments
  - `halving.m` - Secondary script to run to reproduce repeated halving experiments to estimate leverage scores
- `report` - Folder containing the report of the obtained results
  - `report.pdf` - Report of the obtained results in pdf format
